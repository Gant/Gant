There are trivial and yet breaking changes to the way in which things are output in Groovy 1.6.x compared to
Groovy 1.5.x.  In particular, strings in lists are no longer embedded in double quotes on output -- this
makes things more harmonious with the way Java does things -- and the groovyc task no longer issues the
message "No sources to compile" when there are no sources to compile.  Sadly, it means some of the Gant
tests have to distinguish which version of Groovy is being used.  If support for Groovy 1.5.x is removed
then this code must be reviewed and the special code removed.

The Gant Ant task tests requires the Ant XML scripts to have access to the org.codehaus.gant.ant.Gant
class.  This means the path to the class has to be known.  Currently the Ant/Gant build compilation products
are used.  This has "quite interesting" consequences:  in particular, the Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA
and Gradle builds put the compilation products in their own private places.  Unless the Ant/Gant build is
created as well then these other builds will fail a number of the org.codehaus.gant.ant.tests.Gant_Test
tests.  Moreover, both the product classes and the test classes must be built and available, the Gant script
tests relay on being able to access the Gant_Test class.
