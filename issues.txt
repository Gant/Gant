Need some better documentation -- in the source, as manual pages and on the Groovy website.

In an include statement, if the class name cannot be found then you get a weird error message:

  Caused by: groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: org for class: build
          at groovy.lang.MetaClassImpl.getProperty(MetaClassImpl.java:734)

Need to trap all exception that might sensibly happen due to reasonable errors in Gant scripts
so that sensible error messages can be issued.  Also avoids the huge stack tracers.

If there are compilation errors in the Gant file then sometimes the proper error message is not reported,
just an exception stack trace.  Using groovy on the Gant file generally shows the errors but Gant should
have done the right thing in the first place.

Get the GANTLIB stuff finished so it actually works.

task ( flob : '' , thing : '' ) { . . . } is valid but not handled sensibly.

Add a --propertyfile <filename> option.
