/**
 *  A class to hold the global shared state for a run of Gant.  This is needed because parts of Gant are
 *  written in Java and parts in Groovy and it is not possible to compile them all at the same time.  All
 *  references to Groovy classes must be avoided in the Java classes so that the Java can be compiled and
 *  then the Groovy compiled.  This class contains things that should be in the <code>Gant</code> class but
 *  cannot be.
