/**
 *  A class to hold the shared global state for a run of Gant, also a variety of general-use constants are
 *  defined here.
 *
 *  <p>This class was originally needed because parts of Gant are written in Java and parts in Groovy and it
 *  was not possible to compile them all at the same time.  All references to Groovy classes had to be
 *  avoided in the Java classes so that the Java could be compiled and then the Groovy compiled.  This class
 *  contains things that should be in the <code>Gant</code> class but could not be.  All this is no longer
 *  true, so the material could go back into the <code>Gant</code> class.</p>

  //  Ant's Project message priority levels are good for specifying the priority of a message sent to the
  //  log but present an awkward way of specifying the level of verbosity.  We therefore create some aliases
  //  to make code a little more self-documenting.  
  //
  //  Ant appears not to have a silent mode.  Gant allows for a silent mode by adding an extra verbosity
  //  level.  We have to be aware that the constants from Project are effectively an enumeration -- integer
  //  values starting at 0 -- and that the larger the number, the lower the priority of the message.  Thus
  //  if we set the priority of the logger less than MSG_ERR, no messages will be output.
  //
  //  NB Ant appears to output errors to the error channel (System.err by default) and all other messages to
  //  the standard output (System.out by default).  Gant's behaviour to date (i.e. up to version 1.6.1) has
  //  been to output all information to System.out.  For the moment then error information is logged at
  //  MSG_WARN priority, and MSG_ERR is unused.
