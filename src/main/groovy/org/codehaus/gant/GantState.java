/**
 *  A class to hold the global shared state for a run of Gant.  This was originally needed because parts of
 *  Gant are written in Java and parts in Groovy and it was not possible to compile them all at the same
 *  time.  All references to Groovy classes had to be avoided in the Java classes so that the Java could be
 *  compiled and then the Groovy compiled.  This class contains things that should be in the
 *  <code>Gant</code> class but could not be.  All this is no longer true, so the material could go back
 *  into the <code>Gant</code> class.
