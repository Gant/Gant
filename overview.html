      Gant is a Groovy-based build framework.  It can replace the use of Ant and Maven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gant is a lightweight wrapper around Groovy's <code>AntBuilder</code> that allows Ant tasks to be
      scripted using Groovy rather than having to specify the build systems using XML.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Gant file is a specification of a set of targets plus other bits and pieces of Groovy code.  Thus a
      Gant build specification is of a set of targets just as an Ant build specification is.  Each
      target creates a closure in the binding so that it can be called as a function from other targets.
      This means that dependencies between targets are programmed as function calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gant has a number of predefined objects, for example <code>Ant</code> and <code>includeTargets</code>.
      <code>ant</code> refers to a pre-constructed <code>GantBuilder</code> object.
      <code>includeTargets</code> is the object that controls the inclusion of ready-made targets, for
      example <code>gant.targets.Clean</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example Gant script:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
includeTargets << gant.targets.Clean
cleanPattern << [ '**/*~' ,  '**/*.bak' ]
cleanDirectory << 'build'

target ( 'default' : 'The default target.' ) {
  println ( 'Default' )
  depends ( clean )
  echo ( message : 'A default message from Ant.' )
  otherStuff ( )
}

target ( otherStuff : 'Other stuff' ) {
  println ( 'OtherStuff' )
  echo ( message : 'Another message from Ant.' )
  clean ( )
}
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The function <code>depends</code> takes a list of targets and 'executes' them if and only if they have
      not previously been executed.  This means that dependencies can be handled far more flexibly than they
      can in Ant, leading to simpler target structures.
